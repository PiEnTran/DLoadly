   GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID=1ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefgh
   ```

3. **Replace the placeholder values:**
   - `GOOGLE_DRIVE_CREDENTIALS`: Paste the entire JSON content (as one line)
   - `GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID`: Your folder ID from Step 5

## üß™ Testing

### **Test 1: Server Startup**
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

**Expected output:**
```
‚úÖ Google Drive: Connected
‚òÅÔ∏è Google Drive: Configured
```

### **Test 2: File Upload**
1. Download a video through DLoadly
2. Check Google Drive folder
3. Verify user-specific folder was created
4. Confirm file was uploaded

## üîí Security Notes

- **Keep JSON credentials secure** - never commit to git
- **Use environment variables** in production
- **Rotate keys periodically** for security
- **Monitor API usage** in Google Cloud Console

## üö® Troubleshooting

### **"Google Drive service not initialized"**
- Check if credentials JSON is valid
- Verify folder ID is correct
- Ensure service account has access to folder

### **"Permission denied"**
- Verify service account email is shared with folder
- Check service account has "Editor" permission
- Confirm folder ID is correct

### **"API not enabled"**
- Ensure Google Drive API is enabled in Google Cloud Console
- Wait a few minutes after enabling API

## üìä Production Deployment

For production (Vercel + Railway):

1. **Add environment variables to Railway:**
   ```
   GOOGLE_DRIVE_ENABLED=true
   GOOGLE_DRIVE_CREDENTIALS={"type":"service_account",...}
   GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID=your_folder_id
   ```

2. **Test in production environment**

3. **Monitor usage and quotas**
